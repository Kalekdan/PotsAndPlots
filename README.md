# PotsAndPlots

PotsAndPlots is a web application built with React. The core of the project is written primarily in JavaScript, with additional HTML and CSS support. 

## Project Overview

This app was scaffolded using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
While the app's specific functionality isn't detailed in this README, the structure and dependencies suggest it is a JavaScript-driven SPA with React at its core.
